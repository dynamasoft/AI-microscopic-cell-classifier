# AI-Powered Microscopic Cell Classifier
This project uses deep learning to classify different microscopic cell types.

## Features
- Preprocessing and augmentation of microscopic images
- Training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification
- Deploying the model as a FastAPI-based inference API
- Creating a user-friendly UI with Streamlit
- Containerized deployment using Docker & Docker Compose

## Setup
1. Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Microscopic-Cell-Classifier.git
